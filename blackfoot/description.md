# Blackfoot

## Introduction

The Blackfoot is an Algonquian-speaking tribe living in the northern Great Plains of North America. This sky culture has 4 constellation line figures, and names for the Milky Way, the Pleiades, the Orion Nebula, three planets and three stars.

## Description

This sky culture for Stellarium is a transcript of the broad survey of North-American astronomical traditions in the book _Stars of the first people: Native American star myths and constellations_ [#1] (from page 243). The basic information is not collected by this recent author. It is attributed to anthropologists from the early 1900s: _Mythology of the Blackfoot Indians_ published in 1908 [#2], and _The old north trail, or, Life, legends and religion of the Blackfeet Indians_ published in 1910 [#3]. Source [#1] instead collects the data and draws the constellations explicitly, based on the early information in [#2] and [#3].

According to the sources, the Blackfoot often featured the Big Dipper, the Pleiades, and the Morning Star on their tipis, and believe that "when people die, their spirits go into the sky and become stars, thus ever increasing the number of stars in the heavens". The sources include many associated star stories (not transcribed here), and mostly English names.

### Constellations and star names

The constellation __Seven Brothers and Their Sister__ (identified with the Western Big Dipper) represents siblings who escape to the sky when being chased by a bear. The sister is the small star Alcor in one version. This is the version written here: the source doesn't explicitly provide the constellation lines, but identifies it with the modern Big Dipper, as a bowl with a handle, so Alcor is not connected by a line, but is part of the constellation. Two stars are named: the __Little Sister__, also named as __Sinopa__ (translated __Kit-Fox__) in [#3], and "the star at the end of the handle is often called __Last Brother__" [#1]. This constellation was used for time-keeping before the introduction of clocks.

In a second version of this constellation, the youngest brother becomes the North Star, and the sister (who used to carry him) is the pointer star at the lip of the bowl. 

The two main stars in Gemini (Castor and Pollux) are __Ashes-Chief and Stuck-Behind__, twins whose story explains how a particular tipi design came into use.

The __Lodge of the Spider Man__ is the brightest six stars of the Western Northern Crown, representing the stones laid in a circle which used to hold down a tipi. The __Spider Man's Fingers__ is a possible configuration of stars in Hercules (by [#1]), so its structure is uncertain; they would represent five fingers spinning a thread to let the legendary Feather Woman (native name: So-at-sa-ki) down from the sky ("the five bright stars just beyond [the Northern Crown] in the constellation of Hercules are his five fingers" [#3]).

The six stars of the Pleiades (called __Lost Children__ or __Bunched Stars__) represent six poor children and have an associated story which explains why they are visible in the evening sky only from fall to spring, but not the rest of the year.

A constellation called __Hand in the Sky__ has been documented, but not identified (so is not in this dataset). It could be another name for the __Spider Man's Fingers__, or another constellation entirely. An associated story also explains a particular tipi design.

The North Star is called the __Star that Stands Still__ (the other stars walk around it).

### Planets

Jupiter is known as __Young Morning Star__, representing a boy, __Po√Øa__. Venus is known as __Morning Star__, the boy's father. A story explains that they sometimes travel together, but they may also travel apart for many years. At the time when this story was told, they were in conjunction. The names for Mars are not explained in the source.

### Other sky objects

The Milky Way is called the __Wolf Trail__, which represents the shortest path from the sky to the earth. The Orion Nebula is the stone knife of the mythical person __Blood-Clot__, "a culture hero who rids the world of evil" [#1], and is also called __Smoking-Star__.
