# Bugis

## Introduction

The Bugis are an ethnic group on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia a with strong seafaring tradition. This sky culture has 12 constellation line figures (of which two variants overlap in the Big Dipper region, and another two variants overlap in the Orion region), and names for four stars and five other sky objects (the Pleiades, the Coalsack Nebula, the Magellanic Cloud(s), the Milky Way, and Venus).

## Description

This sky culture for Stellarium is a transcript of data recorded in [#1] (Section 24.4.1.3 _Bugis Asterisms_ on page 706), which provides a unified drawing of Bugis constellations from prior sources with overlapping but not identical data (one from 1999, one from 1987). Most stars are identified, and most constellations lines are drawn in [#1].

The Mandar sky culture in [#2] is related (they are neighbouring ethnic groups on the island of Sulawesi) and also overlaps in information with [#1]. Table 18.6 in [#2] (page 562) compares the star names of the Mandar and Bugis (for Bugis, based on a source from 1999); the asterisms are similar, both in name and in form. Source [#2] appears to have mistakes in star identification; this dataset is corrected based on [#1].

### Constellations and star names

The literal text in the main source [#1] is below in quotes. In this constellation data with lines, compared to the lists below:

- CON bugis 001 `Incomplete House` is B (and 6)
- CON bugis 002 `Shark` is C
- CON bugis 003 `Ray Fish` is D (and 8)
- CON bugis 004 `Mandar Widow` is G
- CON bugis 005 `Ship` is E
- CON bugis 006 `Ship` is F (overlapping with E)
- CON bugis 007 `Sign of Three` is J.1
- CON bugis 008 `Plow` is J (overlapping with J.1)
- CON bugis 009 `Widow Before Marriage` is A (and 7)
- CON bugis 010 `Chicken` is 4
- CON bugis 011 `Job’s Tears Stalk` is 5
- CON bugis 012 `Pushed Plough` is 9.

There is some uncertainty in the constellation lines:

- It is not clear if the lines in CON bugis 002 `Shark` are complete; [#2] identifies the stars, while the drawing in [#1] is a pictogram for this constellation (unlike for most others which have line figures). The two don't match well; to match the pictogram better, replaced ι1 Sco with α Ara (towards the tail) plus λ Sco (the fin). Note that the Mandar version of this same constellation is a larger and more realistic structure.

- CON bugis 012 `Pushed Plough` is marked as uncertain in [#1].

One source attributed in [#1] (Ammarell 1999: 122–142) gives the following Bugis asterisms (literal quote):

> * A. bintoéng balué ‘widow-before-marriage’, (α, β Cen)
> * B. bintoéng bola képang ‘incomplete house’, (α to δ, μ Cru)
> * C. bintoéng bale mangngiweng ‘shark’, (Scorpius (south))
> * D. bintoéng lambarué ‘ray fish, skate’, (Scorpius (north))
> *    D.1. (identified without name) ‘lost Pleiad’, (Antares)
> * E. bintoéng kappala’ é ‘ship’, (α to η UMa)
> * F. bintoéng kappala’ é ‘ship’, (α to η UMa; β, γ UMi)
> * G. bintoéng balu Mandara’ ‘Mandar widow’, (α, β UMa)
> * H. bintoéng timoro’ ‘eastern star’, (Altair)
> * J. bintoéng rakkalaé ‘plough stars’, (α to η Ori)
> *    J.1. tanra tellué ‘sign of three’, (δ, ε, ζ Ori)
> * K. worong-porongngé or bintoéng pitu ‘cluster or seven stars’, (Pleiades).

Another source attributed in [#1] (Pelras 1987: 27–32) gives the following Bugis asterisms (literal quote). The capital letters indicate the corresponding asterisms in Ammarell’s list:

> 1. (= K) worong-mpolong ‘Tuft’, (Pleiades)
> 2. wara-wara ‘Burning Coal’, (Aldebaran)
> 3. (= J.1) tanra tellu ‘Triple Beacon’, (δ, ε, ζ Ori)
> 4. manu’ ‘Chicken’, (Canopus, Sirius and Procyon)
> 5. watang-mpata ‘Job’s Tears Stalk’, (α, β Leo)
> 6. (= B) éppang ‘Lame’, (Crux)
> 7. (= A) walu ‘Widow’, (α, β Cen)
> 8. (= D) lambaru ‘Rayfish’, (Scorpius (north))
> 9. tékkoroso ‘Pushed Plough’, (Triangulum?).

### Planets

`Bintoѐng Bawi` is Venus.

### Other sky objects

One source attributed in [#1] and [#2] (Ammarell 1999) gives the following Bugis names:

> * B.1. bembé’ é ‘goat’, (Coal Sack nebula in Crux).
> * M. tanra Bajoé ‘sign of the Bajau’, (Magellanic Clouds).
> * Bintoѐng Nagaѐ is the Milky Way.
